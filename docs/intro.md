Bloom-Bots main goal is to provide an open-source robotic platform for the automation of agricultural tasks
such as:  
-   harversting
-   plant health assement
-   desease control and monitoring
-   plague control and monitoring
-   fertilization

This is an open-source / open-hardware project, and as such replication, improvement and constructive critical input are welcome. 

## goal of this document
Is to  document the process of building the Bloom-bot of both the software and hardware as well as providing easy to follow guides to replicate this robot.

One of the main goals of this project is to provide a robot platform that can be reproduced and improved by the community, this is why we belive in providing easy to follow instructions so this proyect can be reproduced by many, and easily modified for diferent tasks.
