# Point Clouds
in esence is just a data type that ROS uses to store points generated by a depth camera.

PCL is a library that helps with the manipulation of these clouds.

with out these cloud points images alone could not provide reliable mesurements on objects of distances.
 
this like many of the topics in robotics are extensive, so we will atempt to navigate this field in a Simple is better aproach 

## Retrieving a Cloud point from the camera node
1.  install ROS intel realsense camera 
2.  subscribe to pointcloud topic
3.  recive pointclouds frames
4.  process the frame.

### our main goal in this spike is to gain an understanding into how to complete the perception pipeline the main goal is to be capable of settinga traking marker on the object recognized by our image recognition algorithm.
