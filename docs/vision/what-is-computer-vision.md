# What is computer vision ? 

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs â€” and take actions or make recommendations based on that information.    
If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.
how far away they are, whether they are moving and whether there is something wrong in an image.

*   **Classification:** there is a ballon in this image

*   **Semantic Segmentation:** These are all the pixels that bellong to a ballon

*   **Object Detection:** There are 7 ballones in this image at these locations,
    we are accounting for objects that overlap

*   **Instance Segmentation:** There are 7 ballones at these locations,
    and these are the pixels that belong to each one.
