# Docker + ROS 
## necesary evil
whilst developing diferent parts of your robot it is easy to ignore the dependency hell you are brewing on your system with each package you install.
Inevitably you will be spending more effort on managing your caos than to develop any Robot functionality.
As developers we most stride to manage complexity even at the cost of overheadm, like using containers, this article is inspired by the findings of others and as many of my guides its main purpose is to remind my frail human memory of the things i write and the forget how they work.

### Goals
Create a Docker container for ROS and allow to use GUI tools
