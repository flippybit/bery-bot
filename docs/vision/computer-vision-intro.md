## Goals
This is a pretty big subject and in this notebook we will approach this subject with the point of view of a mere user of these complex algorithms,the goal is to give the reader a general overview of the innerworkings of the algorithms so he can understand the strenghts and shortcommings of this field and how to better employ these tools in robotic applications.
