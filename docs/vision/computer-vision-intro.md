## computer vision for robotic applications

This is a pretty big subject and in this notebook we will approach this subject with the point of view of a mere user of these complex algorithms.
The goal is to give the reader a general overview of the innerworkings of the algorithms selected for this project.     
So he can not only understand the strenghts and shortcommings of the algorithms elected for the proyect, but also so he can switch or improve them if he so desires.
